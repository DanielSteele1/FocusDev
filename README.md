# FocusDev
-- This is a work in progress project. After the core features are developed, a 1.0 version will be put online, where new features can then be added. --

FocusDev is designed for developers to increase and organise thier workload. It's a dashboard that includes all sorts of useful features for daily work. for example, if a developer has to handle a ticket or has an important work call, they can add it here and keep on top of things. Accounts will be fully implemented and all user data will be stored on MongoDB. 

Features include:

- Quick links
- Pinboard
- Calander (with upcoming events widget to accompany it)
- Local Weather forecast
- Notes and ToDo functionality
- Reusable code snippet saver tool - so you can just copy and paste reusable code into your work 
- Personal Github commit graph widget

- More ideas to come
